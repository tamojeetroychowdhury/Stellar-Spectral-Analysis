## Stellar Spectroscopic Analysis

The notebooks involve a study of spectra obtained from various telescopes (primarily SDSS, FEROS and UVES spectrometers) of the following targets:

1. Stars from the 47 Tucanae a.k.a. NGC 104 cluster
2. Stars from Messier 3 cluster
3. O and B type stars from Antenna-2 galaxy
4. Supernova SN2004gt

The notebooks are somewhat messy since it is a self-driven project. Data of SDSS was from astroquery.SDSS (https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sdss/sdss.html), while other telescopes data was obtained from ESO Archive (http://archive.eso.org/scienceportal/home).

Primary libraries used are scipy and specutils.
